Aim: The aim of a SPA is to provide a fast, smooth, and seamless user experience by loading a web application as a single HTML page and dynamically updating content without reloading the entire page.
features:SPAs are fast, interactive, API-driven web apps that avoid full page reloads and deliver a smooth user experience.
technologies used: An SPA is constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced by frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue, and connects to the backend through REST/GraphQL APIs. Routing, state management, and caching are used to provide a seamless, app-likeÂ experience.
